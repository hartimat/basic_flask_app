# Welcome to "basic_flask_app"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]

This repo is a basic Flask website that displays information for an upcoming fitness conference and allows the user to register to attend.

## [ BACKGROUND ]

This project was part of my Web Development coursework.  I chose to use the Python Flask framework because of its popularity and the fact that it integrates well with SQLite databases, which I also wanted to learn about.

## [ STACK ]
- SQLite
- Python (Flask)
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

## [ CHALLENGES ]

Being new to Flask, I experienced a learning curve while implementing Jinja2 templates, as well as all of the routes, views, and other classic features of this framework.  Once I got over this initial hump though, it was nice to see how I could easily build out the rest of the website efficiently by using template inheritance, etc.

## [ LESSONS LEARNED ]

This project taught me the benefits of using an existing, well-maintained web framework like Flask to build a reliable front end that can perform CRUD operations on a database.  The existing library functions made connecting and interfacing with SQLite relatively smooth.  I also learned a lot about error checking when implementing the registration form page.  Moving forward, I will seek to include more error checking in future forms that I create due to how much it can help guide the user to provide properly formatted input.
